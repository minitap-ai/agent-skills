# Test Suite Design

Turn an app codebase into a **Minitest suite**: scenarios with visually
verifiable acceptance criteria, a **persona** (the account expected connected at
scenario start), and **dependency edges**. You reach a reviewed `suite.yaml` in a
temp working dir through a disciplined multi-wave analysis, then apply it with the
existing `minitest` CLI.

Read [suite-schemas.md](suite-schemas.md) for the local `suite.yaml` schema and
step-writing rules, and [minitest-target.md](minitest-target.md) for what the
Minitest executor (Mini) can and cannot run. Read both now.

## Iron rules (read first)

1. **You (the main agent) never open a source file.** All investigation is
   delegated to subagents (see "Subagents" below). If you feel the urge to read
   code, a wave's dispatch prompt is missing a question — fix it and re-dispatch.
   Your context holds only the artifacts.
2. **Each wave produces exactly one artifact.** Subagents return facts with
   `file:line` evidence; you merge and design. Subagents never design scenarios.
3. **Waves run in order.** Within a wave, dispatch subagents in parallel.
4. Journeys are derived from **what a user can reach and tap**, never from code
   module structure.
5. **Checkpoints are questions to the user.** Where a wave says "ask the user",
   stop and ask — don't assume.

## Subagents

Every wave except Wave 4 delegates read-only investigation to subagents, and
**each such wave MUST dispatch its own dedicated subagent(s) and write its own
named artifact before the next wave begins.** Collapsing multiple waves into one
broad "explore everything" subagent is a defect — each wave has its own scoped
subagent(s), its own closed-ended questions, and its own artifact. **Do not
proceed to Wave N+1 until Wave N's artifact exists.** Use
whichever mechanism your host exposes, in this order of preference:

- **opencode**: dispatch the `explore` subagent, all subagents of a wave in one
  message so they run in parallel.
- **Claude Code**: dispatch via the `Task` tool (one call per subagent, batched
  in a single message for parallelism).
- **No subagent mechanism**: fall back to running each dispatch **sequentially
  yourself** as a scoped investigation, writing each result into the wave's
  artifact before starting the next. The iron rule still holds in spirit — treat
  each investigation as isolated and record only its facts.

Every dispatch carries four parts: **scope** (where to look / not look),
**questions** (closed-ended, exhaustive), **output schema** (fixed, bounded,
`file:line` on every claim), and **the don't** (no scenario design, facts only).
Embed the relevant recon pointers in each later dispatch so subagents never
rediscover the layout.

## Working directory

Create a **temp working directory** for artifacts — e.g. `mktemp -d` or an OS
temp path — NOT a `.test-suite-design/` folder inside the customer's repo. The
repo stays untouched; the suite is applied through the CLI, not committed as
files. Set `WORK=<temp dir>` and `REPO=<app path>`.

| File | Artifact | Produced by |
|---|---|---|
| `00-recon.md` | Pointer map (stack, routing, auth, flags, strings, analytics) | Wave 0 |
| `01-app-map.md` | Navigation graph + candidate journeys | Wave 1 |
| `02-capability-matrix.md` | Feature × account-variant availability | Wave 2 |
| `03-personas.yaml` | Minimal persona catalog | Wave 2 (derived by you) |
| `04-state-model.md` | Per-journey consumes/produces/destroys + auth trajectory | Wave 3 |
| `suite.yaml` | The reviewed design, applied in Wave 6 | Wave 4, patched by Wave 5 |

## Pre-wave — establish context (ask the user FIRST)

**This pre-wave is mandatory and gates Wave 0. Ask all three as THREE SEPARATE
`question` calls — sources of truth first — and record every answer before you
touch code.** Do not dispatch any subagent or begin Wave 0 until you have asked
all three. The most common failure is diving straight into codebase analysis and
either never asking for external sources of truth or asking late and bundled with
the scope question — that is a defect, not a shortcut. Ask, then analyze.

Ask the user three things as three distinct questions (external sources of truth
first, never bundled) and record the answers:

1. **Sources of truth (your literal FIRST `question`, before any code read or
   subagent dispatch).** Where should ground truth come from beyond the code — a
   product spec, a PRD, a design doc, an existing test plan, a store/website
   link? These capture intent the code can't. Ask for them explicitly **before**
   any codebase analysis and as their own `question` call — never merged with
   context or scope; if the user has none, they say so and you proceed from the
   code — but you must ask before you start. Point subagents at anything named as
   authoritative.
2. **Context (a separate `question`).** What is this app, who uses it, and what
   matters most to test? Anything a codebase read won't reveal (backend states
   you can provision, real accounts you own, known-flaky areas).
3. **Scope (a separate `question`).** Design for the **whole app**, or a
   **sub-part** (one tab, one flow, one feature area)? Scope narrows every later
   wave — confirm the boundary before spending analysis on surfaces the user
   doesn't care about.

## Wave 0 — Recon

One dedicated recon subagent, breadth only. It locates *where things live*:
framework, routing, auth implementation, feature-flag/remote-config surfaces,
entitlement/role checks, i18n/strings, analytics events, build variants. It
answers "where to dig", not "how it works". Merge into `00-recon.md`; every later
dispatch embeds the relevant pointers. **Do not begin Wave 1 until `00-recon.md`
exists** — Wave 0 is not folded into any other wave.

## Wave 1 — Surface mapping

Shard the app by top-level navigation area — **one subagent per tab / drawer
section / auth-gated zone**, enumerated from the recon pointer map, bounded by the
chosen scope, all dispatched in parallel. This is a sharded fan-out, never a
single broad "map the whole app" dispatch. Each returns: screens, entry paths
(tab, button, deep link, push, onboarding), and **candidate journeys** at UX
level.

Ground truth to prioritize over code structure: the wired route/navigation graph
(excludes dead code), analytics events, onboarding/deep-link/push entry points,
i18n/strings, plus any sources of truth the user named.

Merge into `01-app-map.md`, dedup journeys across shards. Keep the ~15–40
journeys a real user plausibly performs; drop admin/debug surfaces unless asked.
**Do not begin Wave 2 until `01-app-map.md` exists.**

## Wave 2 — Gating hunt (the trap wave)

A dedicated wave with its own dedicated subagent(s) — do **not** treat flags/tiers
as incidental Wave 1 findings or fold this hunt into an earlier dispatch.
Parallel subagents hunt what differentiates one account from another: feature
flags (static, build variants, and **remote config** — whose runtime value is
unknowable from code); entitlements/tiers (paywalls, plan checks, role guards,
server-driven `capabilities`); other differentiators (locale/region, verification
state, empty-vs-populated data, A/B assignments).

Merge into `02-capability-matrix.md`: each Wave 1 journey annotated
`visible / hidden / paywalled / degraded / unknown(remote)` per account variant,
with evidence. **Do not begin Wave 3 until `02-capability-matrix.md` exists.**
Then **you** derive `03-personas.yaml`, applying the account-gating
and persona doctrine below — the minimal basis set, never the cross-product.

**What separates one account from another is the highest-value signal in the app — and the easiest to miss.** Two users on the same screen can see different things: a Pro badge, an extra tab, a paywall, a region-only feature, an experiment variant. Hunt these differentiators on purpose while you explore; don't treat them as incidental. Each one you find is a persona worth testing and a flow worth covering; each one you miss is a whole surface that never gets tested.

Look for every axis that gates what a user can reach or do:

- **Tiers and entitlements** — free vs paid plans, subscription levels, `capabilities`/`permissions` on the user, paywalls (hard = blocks the feature, soft = dismissible upsell).
- **Roles and permission guards** — route or screen guards keyed on a role (Driver vs Diner, Admin vs Member), features hidden behind a permission.
- **Feature flags and remote config** — static flags in the build and server-driven ones (LaunchDarkly, Firebase Remote Config, a homegrown `/config` call). A remote flag's real value is unknowable from the code alone: you can see the flag exists, not what it's set to. Model the variant most users see, record the assumption in app knowledge, and never write a criterion that silently assumes one side of a flag you can't read.
- **Locale, region, and verification state** — country/language gates, KYC/age/verification walls, features that only appear once an account is verified.
- **Data state** — empty vs populated (a fresh account with no orders vs a returning one with history) often renders entirely different screens.

**Cover each differentiated capability once, with the cheapest persona that unlocks it — not the cross-product of every feature by every persona.** If a feature behaves the same for Free and Pro, test it once as the cheaper persona; spend a Pro-only scenario on what Pro actually changes. The goal is every capability covered, not every persona re-walking every flow.

**"Cheapest" means cheapest to run, not cheapest to set up.** The two point in opposite directions and the wrong reading is the tempting one: the system "New user" persona looks cheapest because it needs no credentials and no provisioning, while at run time it is the most expensive entry the app has — a full registration funnel before a single assertion, every run. A pre-existing account costs one sign-in. Rank personas by what each run pays, and see ""New user" is for stories whose SUBJECT is being new" in the personas guidance for why that same choice also decides whether the story can have a parent at all.


A **test profile** (persona) represents one specific user identity and state. Stories bind profiles via a many-to-many relation: several profiles may be bound to one story, none is "primary" to the tester, and it picks whichever fits each step of the journey. (Dependency checks compare one of them: the alphabetically first bound profile.)

**Every story is bound to at least one persona.** If you create a story without binding a profile, the system binds the app's **default profile**; when the app has no default, it binds the app's **"New user" persona** (which then becomes the default). Updating a story with an empty profile list binds "New user". "New user" is system-managed and read-only — it cannot be edited, deleted, given credentials or a test card, or marked exclusive — and it represents a genuine brand-new user: the tester proceeds anonymously where the app allows it, and when the flow needs an identity it signs up with an address it makes up itself, `<random>@qa.minitap.ai`, and reads the code from that inbox. Use the "New user" persona deliberately for first-launch, guest-browsing, registration, and anonymous flows — do not create your own "anonymous" or "guest" profile for browsing, and do not treat sign-in as mandatory for it (many apps are usable anonymously). The exception is a persona that owns the address a record is made under, even when the app calls that user a guest — see "State only a commit makes" below.

**"New user" is for stories whose SUBJECT is being new — not for every story that happens to need an account.** First-run onboarding, registration, guest/anonymous browsing, and empty-state checks are what it is for: in each of those, "this account has no history" is the thing under test. A story that merely *requires* someone to be signed in — settings, profile, a stats screen, a feature behind the login wall — binds the cheapest **pre-existing** persona instead, and the difference is not stylistic:

- **It is the expensive choice, not the cheap one.** A pre-existing persona signs in (a few steps); "New user" re-walks the entire registration funnel — often fifteen-plus screens — before the story can assert anything, on every run, forever. That arrival is what exhausts a run's budget before it reaches a verdict.
- **It makes the story ungateable.** A persona that registers itself needs nothing before it, so it can have no parent. Bind a suite's feature stories to "New user" and its dependency graph cannot exist: there is no sign-in for anything to hang off, and a broken login shows up as N separate reds instead of one root cause and N-1 skips.

Measured: a mature 67-story suite binds 52 stories to one pre-existing account and only 12 to "New user" — the 12 being genuinely first-run journeys. A guided onboarding that inverted that ratio (7 of 11 on "New user") produced a suite with two dependency edges and no root, and every one of those seven stories opened by signing up from scratch. If most of your suite is bound to "New user", that is the defect to look at first.

**Proactively create every profile the app needs for thorough testing.** During discovery, identify all distinct user roles, subscription tiers, and permission levels. Each one that affects what the user sees or can do on screen deserves its own test profile. Common examples:

- Free vs. Premium/Pro users (different features, paywalls, limits)
- Different roles (Driver vs. Diner, Patient vs. Doctor, Admin vs. Member)
- Returning user with populated data (vs. the empty-state case, which is the system "New user" persona)

**Freemium and paywalls:** when the app has tiers, create one persona per tier and spell out the entitlements in each persona's `about` field (what this tier can and cannot do). Classify paywalls explicitly: a **hard paywall** blocks the feature entirely for a lower tier; a **soft paywall** shows an upsell that can be dismissed or bypassed. Record which is which (and how a free user gets past a soft wall) in the app knowledge, so the tester never guesses.

**Naming:** name profiles after the app's real personas — not generic labels. A food delivery app has "Driver" and "Diner", not "Standard user". A clinic app with a freemium model has "Patient", "Doctor", "Free User", "Pro User".

**Credentials:** generate a passwordless `@qa.minitap.ai` persona for each profile and leave the password blank. Use a descriptive prefix derived from the role plus the app name, e.g. for an app called "FoodDash": `minitest-free@qa.minitap.ai`, `minitest-driver@qa.minitap.ai`. Leaving the password blank makes the persona OTP-first: at runtime the tester registers/signs in with that `@qa.minitap.ai` address and reads the confirmation or one-time code straight from its inbox — no real backend account needed. **Never invent a password or use a non-`@qa.minitap.ai` domain for a generated persona** — a passwordless non-`qa` address is rejected at creation, and a non-readable inbox defeats OTP. Only set a username + password when the customer has a real account they own (any domain is then allowed). A passwordless persona created with a blank username gets a generated `<random>@qa.minitap.ai` address. The `@qa.minitap.ai` check runs only at creation, so never later swap in another domain or clear the password of a non-`qa` persona.

**Apps that sign in by phone** take a `phone_number` (E.164, e.g. `+14155551234`) instead of, or alongside, the address — plus a `static_otp_code` when the customer's backend accepts a fixed code for that number. Both must be pre-provisioned by the customer: ask them for a whitelisted number and its fixed code, because there is no phone inbox to read at runtime the way there is for `@qa.minitap.ai`. A persona that carries a phone number or a static OTP code has its own way in, so it keeps whatever address you give it — a real customer address is accepted, and no `@qa.minitap.ai` inbox is invented for it (a persona with a static OTP code but no phone and no username still gets a generated one).

**For a persona that needs a specific account state (e.g. premium/pro), generate a `<something>@qa.minitap.ai` persona *with* an explicit password and ask the user to add that email + password combo to their backend** so it is linked to a user in that state — the `qa` address keeps the inbox readable for OTP while the password lets them pre-provision the account. The `about` field must explain who this persona is and what state they need to be in (e.g. "Pro subscriber with an active monthly plan. Has completed onboarding and has at least one saved item.").

**Personas that pay** carry a `test_card`: a sandbox payment card (number, expiry, CVC, holder name, postal code — every field optional, trimmed and otherwise stored as typed; the number allows only digits, spaces and dashes) that the customer's payment provider accepts in test mode, stored encrypted like a password. Set it on the persona that runs the checkout scenarios with `minitest test-profile create|update --test-card-number … --test-card-expiry … --test-card-cvc … [--test-card-holder-name …] [--test-card-postal-code …]`; `update` merges into the stored card and `--clear-test-card` removes it. Where the card comes from:

- **First, Stripe's public test card** (`4242 4242 4242 4242`, `12/34`, `123`) is tried without asking the customer, on any Stripe checkout or one whose provider is unknown (every native app included) — unless the page shows live mode (a `pk_live_` key), where a test card is always declined.
- **If it is refused**, or the checkout is live or another named provider, ask the customer which test card their staging checkout accepts.

Never invent any other card, and never put one in `about`. A card lets the agent fill the payment form; whether it completes the payment is still governed by its own rules.

**For "Sign in with Google", bind no Google credentials and create no profile for it.** Pooled Google accounts are not personas: whenever a criterion needs Google sign-in, the tester leases one from Minitap's shared pool at runtime and fetches its password and 2FA code on demand — none of this is in the prompt, so static credentials would be wrong and unusable. A leased account may already carry data from a previous run, so the tester resets it to a clean starting state before the scenario.

**State must match the scenario.** A story must link a profile whose state actually matches its scenario. Do not bind a generic profile whose state contradicts the story (e.g. an active subscriber on a "lapsed subscriber" story). When no existing profile matches the required state, create a dedicated one and describe that state plainly in its `about` field.

**State only a commit makes.** Some journeys start from a record only a commit creates — an active booking to manage, a placed order to track. When the customer allows that commit in their test environment, a producer story makes it and the stories that read it depend on it (see dependencies). Give that chain a persona whose `@qa.minitap.ai` address owns the record, even when the app has no accounts and that user is a "guest" in the app's words — it is an address the record lives under, not a browsing profile. Its `about` says where the record's data arrives:

- ✅ `minitest-booker@qa.minitap.ai`, about: "Makes and manages bookings. Confirmation numbers and lookup codes arrive in this inbox; use the newest."
- ❌ Asking the customer for an active booking, its confirmation email, or "an email that has never signed up".

Any email field an app asks for takes a `@qa.minitap.ai` address, and a contact phone field nothing is sent to takes a number reserved for fiction (UK `+44 7700 900123`) — only a number that must receive a code is the customer's to provide. When a phone field already shows or has selected a country code (a flag, a `+44` prefix, a country picker), type only the national number and check what the field now shows. A value the form rejects is a field-entry problem: clear it fully and enter it another way (the national digits, the country picked from its picker, the number typed key by key). A value you typed yourself, or data on an account this run created, is never the customer's account to fix. A flow that needs an address nobody has used before runs as "New user", which gets a fresh one every run; a fixed address is spent by its first run. "New user" cannot hold a test card, so when that flow also pays, create a persona that holds the card and whose `about` says: "Sign up with a fresh `<prefix>-<random>@qa.minitap.ai` every run; never reuse this address."

**Personas vs. devices.** A persona is an *identity*; a device is a *surface*, and the two are decoupled — a scenario's device count is set independently of how many personas it binds (see "Device count" below). Bind the personas the journey needs, then decide the device count from *how* those identities are used:

- **Simultaneous identities → multiple devices.** When two identities must be live *at the same time* — real-time chat or a call between two users, a background push one account triggers for another, presence/typing indicators, or cross-account visibility (A blocks B, and B can no longer see A) — each concurrent identity needs its own device so the tester can observe both screens at once.
- **Sequential identities → one device.** When the journey uses identities one after another — post as A, then sign out and check as B — a single device is enough; the tester signs in and out. Binding two personas does **not** by itself require two devices — but because the auto default resolves to one device per bound persona, set an explicit `device_count` of 1 on these stories.
- **Same account twice → two devices, one persona.** A session-conflict test (the same account signed in on two devices) binds a single persona but runs on two devices.

**Constraints:**

- **Names** are unique per app (case-insensitive), at most 255 characters. Username and password ≤255, `about` ≤2000, `static_otp_code` ≤32, `phone_number` is E.164.
- **Deleting** a profile still bound to a story is refused (409); unbind it first.
- **Shared profiles** can be bound but are read-only: they cannot be edited, deleted, or set as default.
- **`exclusive_use`** keeps two concurrently running tests off the same persona (API only; minitest-cli has no flag for it).
- **Status:** each persona has a provisioning status (`untested`, `unverified`, `working`, `failed`). Editing a credential resets it; only a real sign-in sets `working` or `failed`.

**Coverage check:** before story creation, verify you have a profile for every distinct persona visible in the app. Missing a profile means missing entire feature surfaces.

**Default profile rule:** set a default profile only when a single persona is clearly the one most newly created stories should start with (typically the main signed-in account). If multiple personas are equally primary, leave default unset.


**Checkpoint — HARD STOP (a `question` the user must answer):** present the
derived persona catalog and ask the user to confirm it and whether each account
can actually be provisioned. Do **not** start Wave 3 until the user answers this
`question`. This is the one checkpoint worth a human answer — never skip it or
assume the answer.

## Wave 3 — State & auth-transition analysis

For each journey (batch ~5–8 per subagent), answer three questions: **Consumes**
(what must exist before — account-level or device-level?), **Produces/destroys**
(what persists after — reversible in-app or not?), and **Auth trajectory** (does
it sign out, switch, or create an account? default `output_account =
input_account`). This wave dispatches its own dedicated subagents (batched by
journey); do not fold it into an earlier wave. Merge into `04-state-model.md`.
**Do not begin Wave 4 until `04-state-model.md` exists.** Dependencies and account
wiring are now **derived facts**, not guesses.

## Wave 4 — Suite design (you alone, zero delegation)

Compose `suite.yaml` in `$WORK` (schema + step-writing rules in suite-schemas.md),
governed by the doctrine below.

**A user story = a full session, and it is self-contained.** Each story runs as a fresh tester session and owns its own path to the exact state it tests — signing in, onboarding, navigating, and setting up whatever cheap in-app state it needs. It never assumes a previous story left the device in a particular state — in a chain the device and app are shared, so it may start wherever the previous story stopped, and it checks where it is before taking its path. Even a story with dependencies must be runnable on its own. Put that setup path in the **description** (as straightforwardly as possible, so the agent reaches the testable state fast); the acceptance criteria stay focused on WHAT to verify once there. Getting a device, loading the app, signing in, and reaching the feature is the bulk of the cost — once the agent is there, it should exercise the feature exhaustively before the session is torn down.

The only state a story does **not** recreate itself is state that is expensive or irreversible to produce (an upgraded account, a placed order, moderated content). That comes from a real dependency (see the dependencies guidance). Identity comes from the persona bound to the story, never from an earlier story. Everything cheap and reversible, the story does itself.

**Default to ONE story per feature area.** Pack everything reachable in a single uninterrupted session into the same story's acceptance criteria. The criteria list IS the test script; long criteria lists are GOOD, not a smell.

**Only create a separate story when starting from scratch is actually required.** Split a flow into multiple stories ONLY if one of these is true:

1. **App state must change between scenarios** in a way the agent cannot undo in the same session (e.g. "first-launch onboarding" vs. "returning user home screen" — the first needs a clean environment).
2. **A different profile/persona is needed** (e.g. "Driver accepts delivery" vs. "Diner places order" — different accounts, different permissions). **Exception — collaborative journeys:** when a single flow genuinely spans two accounts (sign in as A and send a message, sign out, sign in as B and confirm B received it), keep it as ONE story and bind BOTH personas to it. The tester drives both accounts sequentially on one device, switching accounts as its own setup steps — set an explicit device count of 1, since binding two personas otherwise gets one device per persona. Split only when the two roles run genuinely separate journeys, not when one journey needs both.
3. **A different entry path is required** that cannot be reached by in-app navigation (e.g. "deep link opens product page from external app").
4. **The feature is genuinely independent** and isolating it gives clearer failure signals (e.g. "Login" stays its own story even though every other story logs in — because login failure should not cascade into ten unrelated reds).

**If none of those apply, fold the scenarios into ONE story.** Examples of what to collapse:

- Five separate stories about viewing, updating, and managing a single resource (e.g. orders, bookings, listings) → ONE story covering the full lifecycle in a single session.
- "Add to Cart" + "View Cart" + "Update Quantity" + "Remove from Cart" → ONE story "Cart Management" with the four flows as sequential criteria.
- "Open Settings" + "Toggle Notifications" + "Change Language" + "View About" → ONE story "Settings Screen" walking through each toggle and screen.

**Test before splitting:** ask yourself "could a tester, already logged in and standing on the home screen, walk through both of these without resetting the environment, switching accounts, or restarting the app?" If yes — same story.

**Coverage:** cover every major user-facing flow. Login, registration, onboarding, the app's core value prop, search, profile, settings — if the app has it, there must be a story. Cover the happy path end-to-end AND the paths that can break: failure states, validation errors, permission/auth denials, empty states, and edge cases. Prefer fewer, well-defined stories over many vague ones.

**Feature flags:** when a flow's visible version depends on a rollout or feature flag, model the most common variant (the one most users see). If a major variant is gated to a small rollout, note it in the story description or app knowledge rather than authoring ambiguous criteria.


A dependency is **not** a way to put the device into a prior state. Every story is **self-contained**: it reaches the exact state it tests with its own setup path, then verifies its criteria. Any story — even a leaf deep in a chain — can run on its own; ancestors are never replayed. A dependency does three things:

1. **Fail-fast.** When a parent's run fails (infra error, crash, cancellation), is escalated for review, or completes with its tester reporting that the dependents' starting state is now unreachable (judged by reachability, not severity), the batch engine **cascades a SKIPPED state** to every not-yet-started transitive dependent on the same platform. A parent that merely ends with a critical verdict does **not** skip its dependents on its own. The user sees one root-cause red instead of a wall of twenty.
2. **Device reuse.** The engine runs a chain on one device, in dependency order, launching the app once for the whole chain — so a dependent may start wherever its parent left the app, and must check and reach its own state. This is an optimization the engine applies — never a correctness crutch the story leans on.
3. **Ordering.** A dependent never starts until each of its parents in the batch has finished and been scored, so backend state a parent produced already exists when the dependent runs. A story whose parent is not in the batch runs as a root: batch creation never pulls ancestors in.

Declare these relationships up front — the cascade engine cannot infer them.

### Rule of thumb — when to declare a dependency

Two questions, in order:

> **1. "Would I learn anything useful from running B if its parent A just crashed?"**

- **No → the fail-fast case.** Running it is pure waste; declare the dependency so it cascade-SKIPs.
- **Yes → leave it independent.** B reaches its own state anyway, so it can genuinely test itself even if A failed.

> **2. "To run B, some state must already exist. Can B create that state itself — cheaply and safely — with its own setup (setup ≠ acceptance criteria)?"**

- **Yes → reducible.** Inline the setup into B's own description; declare **no** dependency for it.
- **No → irreducible.** The state is expensive or irreversible to produce (account upgraded, order placed, content moderated). Give it a dedicated story and declare a real dependency on that story.

The bar is **deliberately high**. Cheap in-app state (an item in the cart, a filter applied, a screen navigated to) is always reducible — the story does it itself. The feature's value comes from the few foundational flows (login, onboarding, subscription upgrade) and from genuinely irreversible produced state, not from modeling the whole app graph.

**A record only a commit makes is irreducible, even when the commit is cheap.** A booking or an order is real state under the persona's address, and the agents that explore and check feasibility stop at a commit step unless the customer explicitly allowed that story's commit (`minitest user-story allow-setup-commit`). With that permission, the producer's feasibility check performs its commit, and a direct dependent's check runs the producer first on the same device. Without it, a story that makes the record inline as setup is only ever checked up to that setup step. Give it a producer story on the same persona, and depend on it. Where the customer does not allow that commit, no story can produce the record: scope the reading story to where it stops and say so, rather than inventing a producer.

**Every non-gate edge names its state.** A dependency that exists for device-reuse (not just fail-fast) has to justify itself: name the exact state the parent *produces* and the child *consumes*, and say why that state is expensive or irreversible to re-create — that's what keeps it above the reducible bar. ✅ "Checkout depends on Place Order: Place Order leaves the account with a placed, non-cancellable order that Checkout's refund flow reads." ✅ "Manage a booking depends on Make a booking: Make a booking leaves an active reservation under the persona's `@qa.minitap.ai` address, whose confirmation number Manage a booking reads from that inbox." ❌ "Checkout depends on Add to Cart" — a cart item is cheap in-app state the child sets up itself. **No such state, no edge:** if you can't name it, the dependency is reducible and shouldn't exist. Gate (sign-in/onboarding) edges are exempt — they exist purely for fail-fast, so "requires the persona's session" is reason enough.

**Keep chains shallow** (advice — the server enforces no depth). The dependency graph is a shallow DAG. Counting only non-gate edges (gate roots don't add depth), no chain should run more than **three** levels deep. A deeper chain is a smell: a story buried under that many prerequisites is almost always one that should have inlined its own cheap state instead.

### Isolate write scenarios

A scenario that **produces irreversible state** (places an order, upgrades an account, posts content, cancels a subscription) is a **write** scenario. Keep write scenarios apart:

- **One writer per irreversible resource.** Never let two scenarios mutate the same irreversible state on the same account in ways that can run concurrently — the winner is nondeterministic and both readings become flaky. If two flows both need to place an order, give each its own persona (its own chain) so they can never collide.
- **A write scenario is a chain leaf for anything that reads what it wrote.** If B verifies the result of A's write, B depends on A (irreducible state) and A's write is not re-run underneath B. Do not fan out multiple concurrent writers under one shared setup root.
- **Reads are free to parallelize; writes are not.** Read-only journeys on the same persona can run independently; write journeys on the same persona must be serialized by the dependency chain that owns that state.
- **A persona marked `exclusive_use`** is held by at most one running test at a time: the dispatcher waits rather than run two tests on it concurrently. Use it for an account whose state any concurrent run would corrupt.

### Concrete examples

- **`Login` is a parent of most other flows** — almost nothing else can reach the home screen if login crashes.
- **`Onboarding` is a parent of every flow that needs a fully-onboarded account.**
- **`Place Order` is a parent of `Track Order`** — tracking reads an order only a commit creates.
- **`Edit Profile` is *not* a dependency of `View Profile`** — viewing works whether or not editing did.
- **`Search` is *not* a dependency of `Settings`** — independent journeys that share an app shell.

### One persona per chain (hard rule)

Every story in a chain shares the SAME persona. Identity is **not** carried along a chain: the tester receives the bound persona's credentials on every story, and no signed-in session travels to another device. The system "New user" persona signs up fresh on every story it runs (a new `<random>@qa.minitap.ai` address each time), so a "New user" dependent never sees an account its parent created — bind a standard persona to any chain whose dependents read what the parent made.

Give each persona one **"Sign in as `<Persona>`" root story** bound to that persona's profile, then chain that persona's stories off it — every node, root included, carries that profile. Two personas must be two separate chains, each rooted in its own sign-in story. The backend rejects an edge whose parent carries a different persona than the child's primary persona with `422 persona_mismatch` (a parent with no persona is accepted), so a chain wired wrong will fail to save. **Never change a story's persona just to make an edge legal** — the fix is always to point the story at its own persona's sign-in root.

- ✅ `Sign in as Diner (Diner) → Browse Restaurants (Diner) → Checkout (Diner)` — one persona, one sign-in root, same profile on every node.
- ✅ `Sign in as Driver (Driver) → Accept Delivery (Driver)` and a separate `Sign in as Diner (Diner) → Place Order (Diner)` — two personas, two independent chains.
- ❌ `Sign in as Driver (Driver) → Place Order (Diner)` — two accounts in one chain; Place Order belongs under the Diner sign-in root.
- ❌ Re-binding a child to a different persona purely to satisfy the edge — keep its identity, rewire the edge.

Moving a story and everything that depends on it to another persona is the one legitimate reason to change a bound story's profile. Updating a story with `cascadePersonaToDependents: true` rebinds its entire dependent subtree to the new persona in one write instead of rejecting the change; without it, the update is refused whenever a dependent would be left on the old persona. It rewrites each descendant's bindings to exactly the new persona, dropping any others, and it is a REST `PATCH` field only — minitest-cli does not expose it.

### Constraints (server-validated)

- **Same-app only.** A story can't depend on a story from another app.
- **No cycles.** Direct (A→A), transitive (A→B→A), or longer chains are all rejected.
- **References must exist.** Don't invent IDs; pull them from the story list. A deleted story counts as missing.
- **Replace-all semantics.** `depends_on=[]` clears the set; omitting it leaves it untouched. In minitest-cli, `--depends-on` replaces the whole set, `--remove-dependency` drops individual parents (ignored when `--depends-on` is also given), and `create --depends-on` sets the edges in a second call after the story is created — a rejected edge leaves the story saved without it.
- **Errors.** A violation returns 422 with `detail.kind` ∈ `self_dependency | references_missing | cross_app | persona_mismatch | cycle` and the offending `ids`, one kind at a time.
- **Per-platform isolation.** Dependencies are resolved separately per platform — a failure on one target never skips another target's story. If a parent does not run on a platform (disabled or absent there), its dependents attach to the nearest ancestor that does and are not skipped. You don't declare per-platform; the engine handles it.


Every story has three parts: **title**, **description**, and **acceptance criteria**. Always author all three — the API accepts a story without a description or criteria, but the tester then only has the title as intent and nothing to verify. Limits: title ≤255 characters, description ≤5000, each criterion 1–2000 (no cap on how many).

**Title** — starts with a verb. Action-oriented and user-facing (e.g. "Add Item to Cart", "Comment on Own Game", "Discover Restaurants and Manage Cards"). Never noun phrases like "Restaurant Discovery and Card Management".

**Description** — one or two sentences explaining what the user does and any important scope constraints. This tells the tester agent the intent of the story without reading all criteria. Example: "Logged-in user opens the comments drawer on one of their OWN published games and posts a comment. Do not comment on other users' games." When reaching the tested state is not obvious from the criteria alone, the description is also where you spell out that setup path (how to get there) — the criteria then stay focused on what to verify once there. Keep it a path, not choreography: name the state to reach, not every tap.

**Acceptance criteria** — each criterion is a **job to be done**, not a micro-step or a single interaction. Mini acts like a user, so it can figure out HOW to accomplish a goal up to a point — as long as it's given enough context grounded in how the app actually works. The criteria say WHAT to accomplish and WHAT the expected outcome looks like; the description carries the grounding — the feature/product-area anchor so Mini can orient itself, and the big UX path (a path, not choreography). No Given/When/Then. No exact interaction sequences. No embedded reasoning. Aim for 5-15 criteria per story.

Each criterion **must** be:

- **Visually verifiable** — Mini (the tester agent) judges only what the running app shows, even when it can read the app's source. Write assertions about what is visible: text, UI elements, navigation state.
  - Good: "A success toast or confirmation message is displayed"
  - Bad: "The backend creates a new user record in the database"
- **Specific and unambiguous** — avoid vague assertions.
  - Good: "The cart badge shows the updated item count"
  - Bad: "The cart works correctly"
- **Goal-scoped** — each criterion bundles a small goal and its verification. Do not split a single action and its result into two criteria.
  - Good: "Add an item to the cart and confirm the cart badge increments"
  - Bad (too granular): criterion 1 "Tap the Add to Cart button", criterion 2 "The cart badge shows 1"
- **Ordered** — list criteria in the order they should be observed during the user journey execution.
- **Short and readable at a glance** — one behavior in one plain sentence, ideally under 200 characters. A criterion that has to list every option, label, counter or edge case covers several behaviors: split it, or state the goal and let Mini find the details on screen.
  - Good: "The Recharge screen offers ways to earn credits, including watching a rewarded ad"
  - Good: "Search for 'nutella' and confirm no 'nutella' product appears in the results"
  - Bad: "The Recharge screen shows credit-earning options including a rewarded ad (Watch Ad button with a +5 credits label and a daily cap counter), an invite-a-friend card with a share link, a daily check-in tile, and a disabled state once the cap is reached"
  - Bad: "Open the profile and verify the avatar, display name, bio, follower count, following count, edit button, share button and settings gear are all visible and correctly aligned"

Each criterion **must NOT**:

- Prescribe exact interaction sequences, stepper increments, or input choreography. State the intent: "Add two items to the list" not "Open + Add, pick Item A, confirm, open + Add, pick Item B, confirm..."
- Include internal route paths (e.g. `/(auth)/sign-in`), code identifiers, component names, or implementation details. Reference only user-visible labels, screen names, and UI landmarks (e.g. "the home screen", "the settings page", "the checkout button").
- Hardcode verbatim marketing copy or long strings from the app. Reference content by purpose ("the onboarding slide explains the app's core feature") not by literal text.
- Require anything an agent on a real device or browser cannot check. No server-side checks, no DB inspection.

**Never assert a volatile value.** Cart contents, unread counts, badges, streak days, playback position, and state-dependent labels such as "Add to cart" versus "Go to cart" all change as earlier stories run — and change again on the next run. Assert the capability, not the number that happened to be on screen when the story was written: "the cart control is present and opens the cart", not "the cart badge shows 3". A criterion has to be as true next month as it was the day it was authored.

**Customer-specified test data is part of the WHAT, not the HOW.** When a customer's test case names the value under test — a search term, product, coupon code, amount, address or option — or a precise expected outcome, keep it verbatim in the criterion, quoted in its original language: "Search for 'nutella' and confirm no 'nutella' product appears in the results". The rules against choreography and verbatim copy govern how Mini reaches a goal and the app's own copy, not the data the customer chose to test. Never replace such a value with "e.g.", a category, or a description of it: a criterion that reads "search for a product expected to be unavailable" lets Mini pick its own term, and the customer's case never runs. If the value will go stale (a price, a stock count), keep it and flag the risk to the customer instead of generalising it.

**Never inline credentials or profile-specific data into criteria.** A story's login/account details come from its linked test profile, which the customer can edit at any time. Hardcoding the email, password, or other profile values into a criterion duplicates that data and goes stale the moment the profile changes. Refer to the persona abstractly instead, e.g. "Sign in with the profile's credentials and confirm the home screen loads". At run time the backend also rejects a criterion report whose evidence, summary, failure reason or RCA text contains a persona's password, static OTP code, test-card number or CVC, so never write a criterion that asks Mini to state or confirm one — phrase it as "signs in successfully" instead.

**How a criterion is judged.** Each criterion gets exactly one verdict per run and platform: `success`, `failed` (app behaviour Mini watched go wrong), `unprocessable` (Mini could not verify it — a harness limit or missing setup; the reason names who must act), or `skipped` (downstream of an unprocessable criterion, same root cause). A criterion outside Mini's capabilities comes back `unprocessable`, not `failed`.

**Platform overrides.** A criterion can carry override text per platform (`ios`, `android`, `web`): a run on that platform reads the override, every other platform reads the shared text. An override must be non-empty and differ from the shared text. CLI: `--override <platform>:<id-or-index>:<text>`, `--clear-override <platform>:<id-or-index>`.

**Edit criteria without losing their history.** Every criterion is versioned and each result records the version it judged. Reword one with `--set-criterion <id-or-index>=<text>` (same criterion, new version); restore an earlier wording with `--revert-criterion <id-or-index>=<version_id>`. `--criteria` replaces the whole list and keeps a criterion's identity only when its text is unchanged — a reworded entry becomes a new criterion with no history. The two families can't be combined in one command.

**Examples of bad vs. good criteria:**

Bad (micro-steps):

1. Tap "Next" — slide 2 appears with its title
2. The body text reads "Discover amazing features..."
3. The "Skip" button is still visible in the header
4. Tap "Next" — slide 3 appears with its title

Good (jobs to be done):

1. Advance through all onboarding slides and confirm the final slide leads to the sign-in screen

Bad (over-prescribed):

1. Tap the "+" button — the item picker modal opens
2. Type "blue" in the search field — only matching items appear
3. Clear the search field and tap the "Clothing" category filter
4. Tap "Blue Jacket" — the modal closes and the item appears in the list

Good (goal-oriented):

1. Add two items using the picker, verifying search and category filters work
2. Confirm both items appear in the list with their default details


Design rules on top of that doctrine:

- **Gates first.** For every persona that must be established (onboarding for
  fresh-install personas, sign-in for pre-existing accounts), write one
  `kind: gate` scenario from a fresh app launch that ends established as that
  persona. Every feature scenario depends on its persona's gate — a broken gate
  cascade-skips its dependents.
- **Coverage goal.** Every capability-matrix row covered at least once by the
  cheapest persona that unlocks it, plus every auth-transition journey — NOT the
  feature × persona cross-product.
- **Remote-flagged features.** Template the most common variant and record the
  flag in the scenario's `assumptions`.

## Wave 5 — Adversarial verification

**This wave is mandatory — it is not optional and is never skipped.** Dispatch
each scenario (batch a few per subagent) to a **fresh** subagent that has NOT seen
your design rationale, asking only: *"Given the code, can persona P actually
execute these steps and observe these criteria?"* It checks reachability for that
tier/flag set, criteria observability, and gating mismatches. In parallel, run
your own mechanical invariant pass over `suite.yaml` (full list in
suite-schemas.md), then the suite self-check below. Skipping the fresh-subagent
verification or the mechanical pass is a defect.

**Before the suite is final, audit it as if someone else built it.** You wrote these stories knowing what you intended, which is exactly why you'll miss where they don't hold up. Take one cold pass over the finished set and fix what it surfaces — a few quiet corrections here save the user from a suite that looks complete but doesn't run.

For each story, ask the question a stranger would: **"Given how this app actually works, can this persona reach these screens and observe every criterion?"** If a criterion checks something this tier can't see, a screen this role can't open, or a state the story never set up, correct the story — retarget the persona, inline the missing setup, or fix the criterion.

Then check the structure mechanically:

- Every chain is rooted in its persona's sign-in story, and every story in a chain shares that one persona (no cross-persona edges).
- No dependency cycles, and chains stay shallow — a story buried under many prerequisites usually just needs to set up its own cheap state instead.
- Every persona you created is used by a story, and every persona a story needs exists.
- Every distinct capability and account-differentiator you found is covered by at least one story.
- Every non-gate edge names the state its parent produces and the child reads; a record only a commit makes comes from a producer on the same persona.
- Every story that binds several personas but switches between them sequentially has an explicit device count of 1.
- Every acceptance criterion is checkable on-screen — no database, server-log or analytics assertions. On web, a criterion may compare the page against the API response the page itself received; elsewhere, no network assertions.

Fix issues in place; don't redesign a working suite around one bad edge.


Apply findings as **patches** to `suite.yaml`, not redesigns. Loop once more only
if patches were substantial.

## Wave 6 — Apply through the minitest CLI

There is no `minitest apply`. You replay the reviewed `suite.yaml` by running the
existing CLI commands, in dependency order. Read `minitest <group> --help` when
unsure of a flag.

1. **Distill app knowledge.** Fold the recon + capability findings the tester
   needs at runtime (paywall hard/soft classification, remote-flag assumptions,
   provisioning notes) into an app-knowledge update:
   `minitest app-knowledge update <app id> --content "<distilled knowledge>"`.
   App-level assumptions live here; scenario-local assumptions go in that
   story's description.
2. **Create personas.** One `minitest test-profile create` per persona in
   `suite.yaml` (see minitest-target.md for the `@qa.minitap.ai` mechanics).
   Record each returned id.
3. **Create scenarios in dependency order** — parents before children. For each,
   fold its `steps` into the story **description** as the big UX path plus the
   feature/product-area anchor (minitest stories persist no steps field), pass
   the acceptance criteria, bind the persona, and wire prerequisites:
   `minitest user-story create --name "<name>" --type "<flow type>" --description "<UX path + anchor>" --criteria "<criterion>" [--criteria ...] --profile "<persona id>" [--depends-on "<parent story id>" ...]`
   Set `--device-count` only when minitest-target.md's device rules call for it.
4. **Verify the wiring.** `minitest apps dependencies` to review the graph; fix
   with `minitest user-story update` / `minitest user-story-binding set-profile`.

**Checkpoint — HARD STOP before any CLI creation (a `question` the user must
answer):** present the full planned suite — the persona table, the scenario table
(id, name, persona, input→output account, depends_on), the dependency DAG, and
the coverage summary — and get **explicit user approval via a `question` call
BEFORE creating anything** with the minitest CLI (no app-knowledge update, no
test-profile, no user-story until the user approves). Do not run a single
creating CLI command until the user has approved. After applying, offer to replay
the suite: hand off to the web app's "Run tests" flow, or trigger a run through
the CLI if the user wants one now.
